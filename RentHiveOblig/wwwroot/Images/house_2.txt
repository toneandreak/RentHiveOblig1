Description:
Welcome to this property, which is nicely located and very secluded at the end of a cul-de-sac. Close to the sea and Knarberg marina, which leads you directly into the idyllic Bjerkøysundet with many beautiful island opportunities in the archipelago. The house is also sunny and child-friendly. From the house, it's not far down to the sea. This area offers many great hiking opportunities and is close to the illuminated ski trail. Duken/Knarberg/Nesbrygga as a whole has become a bustling place for families, who also have their "own" island, Barneskjær, where many families meet throughout the summer. There are 2 beaches nearby; for the youngest, Ulvøtangen is recommended, and for the slightly older children, Verdun with a diving board and raft should be a natural choice and a clear first choice for both morning and evening swims. At Skallestad, Nøtterøy Bakery has its own bakery outlet where you can get fresh bread 6 days a week (4-5 min by bike). Oserød school is within walking distance for those with children in primary school, and Borgheim has a secondary school. The Steiner school is about a 10-minute drive from the property. The golf course is also about a 7-minute drive away, where ski trails are maintained in the winter. There are several kindergartens in the vicinity. In Nesskogen Sports Park (located a stone's throw away), there is high activity 7 days a week, whether you are into football, tennis, or athletics. See the attached neighborhood profile that shows the area's facilities and distances to points of interest.
